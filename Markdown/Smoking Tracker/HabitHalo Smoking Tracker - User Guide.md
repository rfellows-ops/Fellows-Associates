# HabitHalo Smoking Tracker - User Guide

## Welcome to HabitHalo! üö¨‚û°Ô∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

HabitHalo's Smoking Tracker helps you gradually reduce your smoking habit through smart pacing and goal setting. Instead of quitting cold turkey, this app helps you extend the time between cigarettes week by week until you're ready to quit completely.

## Getting Started

### First Launch
1. **Open HabitHalo** and tap on "Smoking Tracker" from the main menu
2. The app will automatically set up with default settings:
   - **24 hours per pack** (your initial goal)
   - **20 cigarettes per pack** (standard pack size)
   - **8 hours of sleep** (excluded from smoking time)

### Your First Day
1. When you have your **first cigarette of the day**, tap "First of Day"
2. The countdown timer will start, showing you when your next cigarette is "allowed"
3. For regular cigarettes throughout the day, tap "Regular"
4. When you have your **last cigarette before bed**, tap "Last of Day"

## Main Features

### üè† Dashboard - Your Command Center

The Dashboard is where you'll spend most of your time. Here's what you'll see:

#### Countdown Timer
- **Large display** showing "Smoke in HH:MM:SS"
- **Progress bar** that fills up as time passes
- **"Now" indicator** when it's time for your next cigarette

#### Quick Action Buttons
- **Regular** - Most common button for normal cigarettes
- **First of Day** - Tap when you wake up and have your first smoke
- **Last of Day** - Tap for your final cigarette before bed
- **Start Pack** - When you open a fresh pack of cigarettes
- **End Pack** - When you finish a pack

#### What Happens When Time's Up?
- The timer shows "Now" 
- Your phone **vibrates**
- You'll hear a **sound alert**
- A **notification** appears on your screen

> **üí° Tip:** You don't have to smoke exactly when the timer hits zero! The goal is to wait *at least* that long between cigarettes.

### üìä History - Track Your Progress

The History page shows all your smoking events organized by pack:

#### Pack Groups
- Each pack is numbered (Pack #1, Pack #2, etc.)
- Shows how many cigarettes were in each pack
- Most recent packs appear at the top

#### Event Details
For each cigarette, you can see:
- **Pack #** - Which pack it came from
- **Smoke #** - Which cigarette in that pack (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Time & Date** - Exactly when you smoked it
- **Type** - Color-coded by type (First, Last, Regular, etc.)

#### Editing Your History
- **Swipe right** on any entry to reveal Edit/Delete options
- **Edit** - Change the time, date, type, or add a note.
- **Delete** - Remove a mistaken entry

### üéØ Goals - Your Reduction Plan

This is where the magic happens! The Goals page helps you gradually extend time between cigarettes.

#### Current Goal
- Shows your current pack duration (e.g., "24 hours per pack")
- You can edit this number directly if needed

#### Weekly Increment System
Set up your reduction plan:
- **Week:** How many weeks between increases
- **+ Hours:** How many hours to add each time

**Example:** 
- Week: 1, +2 hours = Every week, add 2 hours to your pack goal
- Week: 2, +1 hour = Every other week, add 1 hour to your pack goal

#### Applying Increments
- **Add 1 Hr.** - Immediately subtracts the increment from your current goal
- **Subtract 1 Hr.** - Immediately adds the increment to your current goal
- **Reset Goal** - Returns to 24 hours per pack

**Example Progress:**
- Week 1: 24 hours per pack
- Week 2: 26 hours per pack (added 2 hours)
- Week 3: 28 hours per pack (added 2 more hours)
- And so on...

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings - Customize Your Experience

- **Cigarettes Per Pack** - Adjust for different pack sizes (10, 20, 25, etc.)
- **Weekly Increment** - Set your reduction schedule

#### Other Options
- **Language** - Switch between English and Thai
- **Export CSV** - Download your data for analysis
- **Save Settings** - Apply all changes

## How the Timing Works

### The Math Behind Your Goals
The app calculates your cigarette intervals using this formula:

**Time Between Cigarettes = (Pack Duration - Sleep Hours) √∑ Cigarettes Per Pack**

**Example:**
- 24-hour pack goal
- 8 hours of sleep
- 20 cigarettes per pack
- **Result:** (24 - 8) √∑ 20 = 0.8 hours = **48 minutes between cigarettes**

### Smart Timing Features
- **Sleep hours are excluded** - No smoking schedule during your sleep time
- **"Last of Day" stops the timer** - No countdown overnight
- **Timer restarts** after each cigarette you log

## Tips for Success

### üåü Best Practices

1. **Be Honest** - Log every cigarette for accurate tracking
2. **Start Realistic** - Begin with a comfortable pack duration
3. **Gradual Increases** - Small weekly increments work better than big jumps
4. **Use the Timer** - Wait for the countdown before your next cigarette
5. **Track Everything** - Use Start Pack/End Pack to monitor consumption

### üìà Making Progress

**Week 1-2: Getting Used to It**
- Focus on logging every cigarette
- Don't worry about the timer too much
- Get comfortable with the app

**Week 3-4: Following the Timer**
- Start waiting for the countdown to reach zero
- Notice how the intervals feel
- Adjust your increment if needed

**Month 2+: Building the Habit**
- Stick to your weekly increments
- Celebrate longer intervals
- Consider increasing your weekly increment

### üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't skip logging** - Missing entries makes timing inaccurate
2. **Don't increase too fast** - Large jumps often lead to failure
3. **Don't ignore "Last of Day"** - This prevents overnight timers
4. **Don't stress about perfection** - Some days will be harder than others

## Understanding Your Data

### Color-Coded Types
- **Green (First)** - First cigarette of the day
- **Red (Last)** - Last cigarette before bed
- **Blue (Start)** - Beginning of a new pack
- **Purple (End)** - Finishing a pack
- **Gray (Regular)** - Standard cigarettes

### Reading Your Progress
- **Pack Duration** - How long each pack lasts you
- **Cigarettes Per Day** - Average daily consumption
- **Interval Success** - How often you wait for the timer

## Troubleshooting

### Timer Issues
**Timer shows "Tap 'First of Day' to start"**
- You haven't logged any cigarettes today yet
- Tap "First of Day" when you have your first cigarette

**Timer stuck at zero**
- You may have tapped "Last of Day" 
- This is normal - it prevents overnight countdowns

**Timer not counting down**
- Check if your pack duration and cigarette count are set correctly
- Make sure you've logged at least one cigarette today

### Notification Problems
**Not getting notifications**
- Check your phone's notification settings for HabitHalo
- Make sure "Do Not Disturb" isn't blocking the app

**Notifications coming at wrong times**
- Verify your sleep hours setting
- Check that you're using "Last of Day" before bed

### Data Issues
**Missing cigarettes in history**
- Remember to log every cigarette as you smoke it
- You can manually add missed entries by editing your history

**Wrong pack numbers**
- Use "Start Pack" when opening a new pack
- Use "End Pack" when finishing a pack
- This helps the app track your consumption accurately

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I have to wait exactly for the timer?
**A:** No! The timer shows the *minimum* time to wait. Waiting longer is even better for your goals.

### Q: What if I smoke before the timer is up?
**A:** Still log it! The app will restart the timer. Don't feel guilty - progress isn't always perfect.

### Q: How fast should I increase my pack duration?
**A:** Start with 1-2 hours per week. You can always adjust based on how it feels.

### Q: Can I pause my progress?
**A:** Yes, just don't apply weekly increments. Keep your current pack duration until you're ready to continue.

### Q: What if I finish a pack faster than my goal?
**A:** That's normal! The goal is an average. Some packs might be faster, others slower.

### Q: Do I need to buy the premium version?
**A:** The free version includes all core features. Premium removes ads and may unlock additional modules in the future.
